# MaxTheMooshroom's OS (MTMOS)
Current version: 0.1.0
 
This is an OS I'm creating for computercraft. Currently a WIP, I would not recommend installing yet, but feel free to peruse the code.

### Coming Updates
- [ ] `net` package. Will include a wide range of networking capabilities for Computercraft devices, including ssh and ftp protocols being integrated with the shell.
- [ ] `security` package. Will allow for more secure use of Computercraft devices. This includes hashed passwords, secure network protocols, etc.
- [ ] `hive` package. Will include turtle swarm control capabilities
- [ ] `external` package. Will include controlling a network of computers running `MTMOS` to be controlled from a website that I'm working on.
